	5.Create a Class MethodCalling which should have m1(), m2(String), m3(int) and m4(double) methods, each method should have a print statement and should print the value passed in parameter. Create a main method and create object of MethodCalling class and call only m1 method. 
	 Please note that method m1() should call m2("Java"), m2 should call m3(51), m3 should call m4(25.5).

	6. 
	Create a Class Shape, in Shape create 3 parameterized constructors
	- 1 int parameter
	- 2 int parameters
	- 3 int parameters
	Create getArea() method, it should check 
	if only one parameter has value then it should call calcCircleArea method and print result, 
	if two parameters have value then calcRectangleArea should be called, and 
	if all three parameters have value then it should call calcTriangleArea 
	The value of parameters should be greater than 0, then only it will be considered.

		- double real
		- double img
		- Complex(real,img)
		- static void add(Complex c1, Complex c2)
		- static void subs(Complex c1, Complex c2)
		- static void mult(Complex c1, Complex c2)
		- void add(Complex c2)
		- void subs(Complex c2)
		- void mult(Complex c2)
